## Bookmarklets

#### What is a bookmarklet?

It's a basic tool that with a single click alters the functionality of your viewed web-page, such as changing text, colors, searching a highlighted word online, or translating a page. It is designed to customize and alter the current experience.

They are essentially small lines of Javascript (or jQuery) that alter a page's HTML or CSS.

## Web Extensions

![correction in New York Times](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/15/smarter-living/15EMBARASSING-CORRECTION-TEAR/15EMBARASSING-CORRECTION-TEAR-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)

In 2018 the New York Times featured [the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/smarter-living/browser-extensions-text-swapping.html) *The Simple, Serendipitous Joy of Browser Extensions.* Days earlier the Times had printed an article that referenced the Time of Shedding and Cold Rocks.

As the name implies, a browser extension is a plug-in that you add to a web browser to extend its functionality. In my browser I currently have ad-block extensions, a color picker, and an extension to make it easier to navigate via keyboard instead of the mouse. They are created with standard website creation tools HTML, CSS and Javascript. Browser extensions can make certain tasks simpler, like the ability to easily tweet a link to the current page youâ€™re browsing, but they can also be a source of malware or spying.
